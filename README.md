# New York City Citi Bike Rides 2024-2025

My project is based on total rides using Citi Bikes in New York City of 2024. Source of data came from [citibikenyc.com](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

I've used R to combine multiple datasets (approximately 40 datasets totaling over 40 million rows), manipulate the merged data, then performed statistical analysis and created visualizations

# Key Questions & Objectives

* Where do Citi Bikers start their rides from and bike to on a regular basis? 
* What time of day are rides most frequent? 
* What days of the week are most rides taken on? 
* Are bike riding habits the same for members and casual riders?
